      <p>
        My name is Justin Luciano.  Welcome to my page!  I use to be a professional
        actor, but during some reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic I decided to
        explore the idea of shifting into a Software Development career path.   I was 
        hooked as soon as I started.   I'm now currently enrolled in the Flation School 
        Intensive bootcamp so that I can aquire the skills necessary to pursue this new 
        passion of mine.
